Weatherboard
============

The source code for my e-paper based weather display. This is more here as a demonstration of what can be done and how to do it; this code is likely not very reuseable!

* `display/` contains a basic Python script that renders an image onto the e-paper from a URL or local file
* `server/` contains the server that this script is scheduled to fetch an image from periodically, and which renders the actual weather display
